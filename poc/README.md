## Service Defintion

`net.jeffsbox.services.ExampleService` is simply the defintion of the REST service.

## Bean Configuration

`src/main/resources/spring/applicationContext.xml` defines the JAX-RS/CXF REST service bean 
and where the Camel routes are defined. 

## Camel Route

`net.jeffsbox.routes.Routes` connects the JAX-RS/CXF service bean to Camel. Camel intercepts the web service call
and outputs the JSON request to the console, then responds with `['SUCCESS']`.

# Note

If deploying on JBoss AS 4.2.3, wait a few minutes for all the wiring to complete. You may get 500 errors if it has not completed. Not sure why this is.
